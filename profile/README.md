ENVITED stands for **Environment for Virtual Test Drive** encompassing all components for virtual test and validation of Advanced Driver Assistent Systems (ADAS)
including but not limited to standardized data sets, e.g. digital maps, scenario data, simulation models and their respective test and validation methods.
OpenMSL aims to connect and demonstrate the seemless interaction of projects in the domain using elaborate test pipelines, also to assure the compliance of all simulation entities with relevant standards.
A list of utilized standards and tools can be found [here](/doc/related_work.md).

All repositories are organized in sub-libraries and each sub-library (SL) represents the best practices in the automotive industry on
how to use, create and apply standard compliant simulation data and models regarding a specific topic or application area guided by expert maintainers of the ENVITED community.

As part of these best practices, OpenMSL provides unified test architectures for simulation components.
For OSMP compliant simulation models, an [OSMP Test Architecture](/doc/osmp_test_architecture.md) is definied.
The architecture is applied in the template repositories of the corresponding sub-libraries.

Learn more about the ENVITED research cluster of the Automotive Solution Center for Simulation e.V, our governance rules, contribution guidelines and our code of conduct [here](/README.md).

We are looking forward to welcome you as member of our community!

  > This model is a highly parameterizable generic perception sensor and tracking model. It can be parameterized as a Lidar or a Radar. The model is based on object lists and all modeling is performed on object level.
  > It includes typical sensor artifacts like soft FoV transitions, different detection ranges for different targets occlusion effects depending on the sensor technology as well as simulation of tracking behavior.
  > The model output are object lists for OSI SenorData moving objects.
  >
  > The architecture of the model as well as the parameterization structure are designed to be as generic as possible
  to fit both radar and lidar sensors to utilize similarities in signal propagation and signal processing in both technologies.
  > This way, the model can be parameterized to model different kinds of lidar and radar sensors. To give an example: You can set an irradiation pattern for the modeled sensor. Depending on the sensor technology this can either be an antenna gain pattern for radar or a beam pattern for lidar.

  > The here provided 15 concrete parametrized test scenarios are derived from the 6 subject areas analogous to Annex 5, Chapter 4.1-4.6 as an initial attempt to clarify the described set of functional scenarios.
  >
  > Each concrete scenario is complemented by a variation file to form a logical scenario, which then represents a set of concrete scenarios.
  > By applying the parameter variation defined in the variation files to the parameters in the concrete scenarios, multiple concrete scenarios can be derived or generated to cover the required scenario space.
  >
  > The focus of the here provided scenarios is on securing the planning aspects of an "Automated Lane Keeping System".
  > By extending the scenarios with environmental conditions (e.g. light, rain or wind) or references to e.g. 3D models, aspects of sensor and actuator technology could also be simulated and validated.
